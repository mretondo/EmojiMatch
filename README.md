# EmojiMatch
This is a simple Concentration style game. I created it as a tool to learn Swift. It's a fun distraction game when waiting in long lines.

1. Pick an Emoji theme.
2. Tap on two cards to revile the emoji on the underside of card. If cards match they will disappear, if not they will flip back over. A flip count is kept for every card you tap, higher score is better (max 20). If you forgot a matched card seen before you will loose a flip count so negitive scores are posible.
